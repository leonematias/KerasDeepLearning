# KerasDeepLearning
Multiple deep learning experiments using Keras + Python + Jupyter notebook:
- Date format prediction: using a RNN network with an encoder-decoder architecture to infer date formats
- stock-prices-classification-conv1d: using a Conv1D network to predict stock prices as a classification problem
- sp-500-analysis-regression: using MLP network to predict S&P 500 future prices as a regression problem
